Each level your speed will increase by either SpeedMin or SpeedMax. This selection is random.
level 1 = SpeedMin = 1/10 * 1 + 0.025 or SpeedMax = 2/10 * 1 + 0.025
level 2 = SpeedMin = 1/10 * 1 + 0.045 or SpeedMax = 2/10 * 1 + 0.045
level 3 = SpeedMin = 1/10 * 1 + 0.065 or SpeedMax = 2/10 * 1 + 0.065
level 4 = SpeedMin = 1/10 * 1 + 0.085 or SpeedMax = 2/10 * 1 + 0.085
level 5 = SpeedMin = 1/10 * 1 + 0.10 or SpeedMax = 2/10 * 1 + 0.10
level 6 = SpeedMin = 1/10 * 1 + 0.11 or SpeedMax = 2/10 * 1 + 0.11
level 7 = SpeedMin = 1/10 * 1 + 0.12 or SpeedMax = 2/10 * 1 + 0.12
level 8 = SpeedMin = 1/10 * 1 + 0.13 or SpeedMax = 2/10 * 1 + 0.13
level 9 = SpeedMin = 1/10 * 1 + 0.14 or SpeedMax = 2/10 * 1 + 0.14
level 10 = SpeedMin = 1/10 * 1 + 0.15 or SpeedMax = 2/10 * 1 + 0.15
