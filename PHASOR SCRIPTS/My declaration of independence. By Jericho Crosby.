My declaration of independence. By Jericho Crosby.

I want to live independently and alone.
 
This will mean that I will pay for my own food, water, gas and electricity. My clothing, costs of transportation, and leisurely activities; including my internet.
 
I want to be responsible for everything in my life without the help of others, including cooking, washing, paying taxes, arranging doctor's dates, planning a trip and even going to the movies.
 
I am emotionally ready to be independent. Living alone is not sad. Living alone is not ungodly or evil. Living alone does not mean that I need a "help mate".
 
I am my own best friend. Nobody knows or cares about me more than myself. I will enjoy entertainment alone. I will read and listen to music alone. I will enjoy a cup of tea or coffee, a cigarette and watch the television alone. I will do my house chores alone, play on the computer alone, eat and sleep alone and nobody can stop me.
 
No rules, no arguing. My house, my life. No parents, no brothers or sisters. Just me and my independence. For this is my goal in life. One day, I will move away. Far, far away - living life to the fullest. Both free and independently. Yes, I have a pronounced lack of need for direct contact with other human beings and human communities. I have never belonged to my country, my home, my friends, or family. But with my whole heart in the face of all these ties, I have never lost a sense of distance and a need for solitude. Until now.
 
I will find work, I will work. I will make money and I will save money. I will spend money alone. I will come home to an empty house - I will enjoy this. I will enjoy living an independent life, alone, without the need of help from other people - Without people telling me to "do this" and "do that". Without people telling me to "do it this way", and "do it that way". I will be selfish. Not selfless. Very few people took the time to help me. Why should I help others? I was only ever mocked, judged, tortured (emotionally), bullied, humiliated, rejected and despised. I have felt alienated and isolated for the longest time. I understand that I only ever focus on the little problems. I once had a Community Support Worker who recently discharged because he felt he'd done all he could to help me.
 
I would set a goal - tell him about it. He would attempt to mitigate, resolve and help me meet that goal, but I would back-track, make excuses for myself, and come up with various reasons as to why I couldn't continue to pursue that goal. I was reluctant to admit that I had some deep personal, unresolved issues. Some so deep and personal that I felt suicidal talking about them. I have been through many periods of deep states of depression. And other periods of joy, where I feel like I can conquer the world. Living with depression, and anxiety has taken a huge toll on me over the years. I might look at seeking out professional counselling again.
 
There is only so much any one person can do to help in a situation like mine.
 
I have a very small support system in my life. Consisting of 2 main people. We do not live in the same country. Although, we communicate via Skype, frequently. I am by no means a narcissist, and I wholeheartedly appreciate everything these people have done for me so far. Any time they need help, I will offer it gracefully. As they have done for me.

- Finally coming to terms independence. True independence. And Denial - it gets you every time.
