Just to clarify, argument 1 is /afk, and argument 2 is the player's number, in this case, 1 (being me) as I am the only person in the server.

-- CHAT
I type: /afk 1
Dedicated Server Console tells me the value of the second argument was 1 like so:
-- The value was: 1

-- RCON
I type: sv_afk 1
Dedicated Server Console tells me the value of the second argument was "1" (in double quotes) like so:
-- The value was: "1"
